# Deep Learning for Extracting Adverse Drug Reactions from User Reviews

We have proposed a novel approach to extract adverse drug reactions from the user reviews with DDI.

Using bidirectional LSTM â€“based RNN and CRF for future scope.

Using deep learning techniques in  ADR extraction from free-text reviews.
